\section{Schedule}

% This project will be completed over A, B and C terms. A term will consist mostly of planning and preparation. B term will consist of constructing and some testing. C term will consist of final testing and implementation.
% \subsection{A term}
% In A term, we will lay out designs and details for the project. We will design and print a control board for the motors and order some major components by the end of the term.
% % Plan everything
% % Design \& print board
% % Order some parts
% \subsection{B term}
% In B term, we plan to build and test the prototypes of our robot. By the end of the term, we plan to have one completed link to demonstrate. In addition, we will have a computer program that will control the arm.
% % Build, test, refine
% % Completed link
% % Computer program to control arm to position
% \subsection{C term}
% In C term we hope to test and implement our final programs on the robot. We hope to have a fully constructed arm made up of link modules, custom control boards on each link, control code on each link, software to control the arm, and a program to play Chutes and Ladders with the robot.
% Test \& implement
