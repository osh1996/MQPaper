design an educational platform
We made a platform that could, in principle, be used for education
Structure of final project met original goals
Staffing circumstances and time constraints made achieving the original goal difficult, but we did in fact get a proof of concept out there. It is achievable

CAD -> 3D print, iterate

UML -> code, iterate

Design + read datasheets -> breadboard -> miniPCB -> full PCB

Enormous roadblocks:    CAN. HID. Project redesign. Linux / Windows compatibility: solidworks doesn't run on linux. Code written on Windows for Tiva didn't work on Linux. 3D printer's tolerance needed to be iterated many times. 3D printer settings needed to be rewritten from scratch.

Turns out joint boards need to be powered from USB port, not just motor & logic power. The fix is to power the boards at 5 volts on the logic line.

Embedded code led to problems that couldn't be solved by thinking, but rather by brute force elimination of possible root causes

You design the project. Hardest kind of MQP. You tell the advisors what you're doing and then you do it. When you hit a roadblock it's not just a question of how can we overcome it, but also a question of, isit worthwhile to persevere or should we aim for more achievable goals?


The Engineering Process: Research. Plan. Design. Build. Test. Iterate.

At its heart, this project embodied the three pillars of Robotics Engineering. We got to use so many skills. In the end we made something that we feel is a valid proof of concept.

We spent a significant amount of time defining project deliverables (Outlined in Appendix \ref),  but due to changes and project organization, the goals had to be revised.



We achieved many of our basic goals. There is still much to be done to accomplish the full scope of the original project narrative. Future iterations of this project could focus on adding higher level functionality to our platform. An example would be utilizing the torque sensing capability or other sensors to add additional control methods, such as torque control and gravity compensation, or maybe even velocity control.
