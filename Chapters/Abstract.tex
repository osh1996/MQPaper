\noindent \textbf{\Large Abstract} \\

\noindent Low-cost robotic arms are becoming much more popular in educational settings. The goal of this project is to create a proof of concept for a modular robotic arm. To accomplish this, we have modified an existing arm to use our own modular control system, created a removable joint that can be connected to the end of the arm, and created an end-user interface which allows visualization of the armâ€™s movement in real time. Creating this arm will make robotics education accessible to a larger number of people, without compromising the potential for each person to gain a high quality understanding of the way robotic arms behave. \\
